File `data_generate.ipynb` can be used to generate accurate answers for benchmarks, which can be used to check whether the codes are functionally correct. The generated data will be saved in the file folder `data`.

File `cmd.txt` contains the commonly used commands to run the source codes and view plain text report (Sometimes the graphic vitis_analyser is quite slow and unstable).
